			Your goal is to stay on the platform as
			long as you can while the wall moves towards. There is a gap or whole in the wall you must move towards it
			as fast as you can before you are launched off the platform. This sounds easy which it was so I added
			rainning blocks and a gun to launch the Blocks. Plus the walls will speed up, more blocks will spawn and the
			wall gap will get smaller the longer you stay on the platform.
