			My submission to Search for a Star 2021 competition
		</h3>

		<p id="pText">
			This project was part of one of my modules for my masters degree. It required students to develop a Game in
			a week. The competition allowed the participants to use one of two engines Unreal or Unity. I chose to use
			Unity because I was more Familiar with the tools and layout of the engine. Due to being more comfortable
			with the Unity I decided to pick a topic that would take me out of my comfort zone and improve my skills. I
			decided to start learning about inverse kinematics ("Inverse kinematics is the use of kinematic equations to
			determine the motion of a robot to reach a desired position.") due to the limited animations you could find
			online I wanted to be able to have more customize ability so if I had a spontaneous Idea of something to add
			then the worry of finding suitable animations would not be a problem.

			In my eyes this was a win win situation because I could enter the competition with a possibility of winning,
			but also learn new skills at the same time.

			GAME IDEA
		</h1>

		<p id="pText">
			I always enjoyed games like Resident Evil, they would always introduce an issue or scenario that required
			the
			player to explore certain areas that they didn't particularly want to go, but was required to progress the
			story I stole this idea and added a
			bit of Call of Duty Zombies round based gameplay.
